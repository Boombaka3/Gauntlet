## Phase 2 — 2026-06-06

### AI-generated (scaffold — review before shipping)
- `apps/evals/models.py` — updated: added `baseline_run` FK to `EvalSuite`
- `apps/evals/schemas.py` — all Pydantic schemas (In/Out/Patch per resource)
- `apps/evals/router.py` — all 13 endpoints; `_get_or_404` helper; `SUPPORTED_MODELS` list
- `apps/evals/adapters/base.py` — `AdapterResult` dataclass, `ModelAdapter` ABC, `from_model_id` factory
- `apps/evals/adapters/anthropic.py` — Anthropic SDK, retry on 429, latency + token_count
- `apps/evals/adapters/openai.py` — OpenAI SDK, `OpenAICompatAdapter` subclass for Ollama/vLLM
- `apps/evals/adapters/gemini.py` — google-generativeai SDK, rate-limit detection via string matching + `ResourceExhausted`
- `apps/evals/scoring/exact_match.py` — difflib ratio ≥ 0.95
- `apps/evals/scoring/rubric.py` — Claude judge call, JSON parse, weighted overall (0–1)
- `apps/evals/scoring/llm_judge.py` — delegates to rubric; fallback single-criterion path
- `apps/evals/scoring/regression.py` — calls llm_judge, diffs against baseline ScoreResult
- `apps/evals/tasks/dispatch.py` — chord fan-out, schema_context propagation
- `apps/evals/tasks/run_model.py` — adapter call, S3 raw output upload, never raises
- `apps/evals/tasks/score.py` — per-mode dispatch, bulk_create, S3 report upload
- `apps/evals/prompts/judge_score.txt` — rubric scoring prompt with escaped JSON shape
- `apps/evals/prompts/judge_regression.txt` — regression comparison prompt
- `config/urls.py` — added health router

### Paths requiring manual review before production
- **Error handling in scoring** — `score_rubric` falls back to `overall=0.0` on any Claude API failure; verify this default is acceptable or surface it as a distinct error state.
- **S3 key construction** — `evals/{schema_name}/{eval_run_id}/{model_run_id}.txt` — confirm bucket policy allows worker IAM role writes.
- **Chord callback** — `score_all_results.si()` ignores `run_model` return values. If a Celery broker restart happens mid-chord, inflight tasks may replay; ensure idempotency (`bulk_create(ignore_conflicts=True)` covers ScoreResult).
- **Gemini rate-limit detection** — string-matching on exception message; replace with explicit `google.api_core.exceptions.ResourceExhausted` catch once confirmed the import is available in your environment.
- **`regression_threshold` default** — currently 0.3 (any drop > 0.3 fails). Tune per suite before enabling regression alerting.

### Manually rewritten
- None yet.

## Phase 1.5 -- 2026-06-06

Phase 1.5 -- bin/ restructure and tests/ scaffold. All .ps1 rewritten to fix string terminator bug.

- Moved `start_stack.ps1`, `stop_stack.ps1`, `dev.ps1` from project root into `bin/`
- Root cause of parse error: em dash in UTF-8 encodes as bytes E2 80 94; byte 0x94 is RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK in Windows-1252 (PS5.1 default), terminating strings mid-line
- Fix: all strings in .ps1 files now use single quotes or concatenation; zero non-ASCII characters remain
- `$PSScriptRoot` in `bin/` scripts resolves to the `bin/` dir; `Split-Path $PSScriptRoot -Parent` reaches project root
- Created `tests/conftest.py` with `django_db_setup` (session-scoped), `tenant_schema`, and `client` fixtures
- Created `tests/evals/.gitkeep` placeholder
